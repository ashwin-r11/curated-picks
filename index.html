            <strong>Curated Picks</strong> is an independent product discovery site focused on
            well-designed, practical items for everyday life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of ranking dozens of products, we highlight a smaller set that stands out
            for function, design, or long-term usefulness. Each recommendation solves a specific
            need — not trends or promotions.
          </p>
          <p class="about-section__note">
            Some links lead to Amazon. Purchases through them may earn a small commission at
            no extra cost to you. This supports the site but doesn't influence what we feature.
