                A mesh tray that mounts beneath your desk to hold power strips, adapters, and
                excess cable length. The open mesh design allows airflow to prevent adapter
                overheating. Popular models from J Channel, VIVO, and similar brands install
                with screws or heavy-duty adhesive.

                A large surface pad that unifies your keyboard and mouse area while protecting
                the desk from scratches. Leather options develop patina over time; felt variants
                offer a softer aesthetic. Look for sizes around 80x40cm (31x16 inches) for full
                keyboard coverage. Available from Orbitkey, Grovemade, and various manufacturers.

                Look for 120gsm+ paper to prevent bleed-through with most pens. Popular options

                A desk lamp with adjustable color temperature (typically 2700K-6500K) allows
