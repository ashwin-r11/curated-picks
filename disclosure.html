            <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>

            <p>
                This website participates in affiliate programs, which means we may earn
                a commission when you purchase products through links on this site.
            </p>

            <h2>Amazon Associates Program</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>As an Amazon Associate, this site earns from qualifying purchases.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Curated Picks is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program,
                an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to
                earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.
            </p>

            <h2>What This Means For You</h2>

            <p>
                When you click on product links on this site and make a purchase on Amazon,
                we may receive a small commission. This commission comes from Amazon—it does
                not increase the price you pay.
            </p>

            <p>
                We only recommend products that we believe provide genuine value. Our
                recommendations are based on research, general product characteristics,
                and practical utility—not on commission rates or promotional arrangements.
            </p>

            <h2>Product Information</h2>

            <p>
                Product details, availability, and prices on Amazon may change at any time.
                The information on this site represents general product categories and
                characteristics, not guaranteed specifications. Always verify current details
                on Amazon before purchasing.
            </p>

            <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>

            <p>
                Affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content. We do not
                accept payment to feature specific products, and we do not receive free
                products in exchange for reviews.
            </p>

            <h2>Questions</h2>

            <p>
                If you have questions about this disclosure or our affiliate relationships,
                you may contact us through the information provided in our
                <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
